# How to use it?

Currently, you can use only the Custom command, as the others one are not completed.

So, type custom and then y:

Then type the most recent one(you can see its creation date and hour under it) that is similar to this format: .../roblox/version/.../content

After, provide the path of your custom images

And if everything has been right, the robloc cursor should have been replaced by your custom one(s)!

# Backup

In order to refrain from incidents, after you have provided your custom  image(s), the default roblox files are transfered to a folder named roblox_default_files.
If you want to acees this folder, this is its directory ..your-user-profile-goes-here../roblox/version/.. your-roblox-version-goes-here../content/textures/Cursors/KeyboardMouse/roblox_default_files
