And if everything has been right, the robloc cursor should have been replaced by your custom one(s)!

## Backup

In order to refrain from incidents, after you have provided your custom  image(s), the default roblox files are transfered to a folder named roblox_default_files.
If you want to acees this folder, this is its directory ..your-user-profile-goes-here../roblox/version/.. your-roblox-version-goes-here../content/textures/Cursors/KeyboardMouse/roblox_default_files

If you also by accident delete the backup file, you can find the default roblox cursors in the classic folder
